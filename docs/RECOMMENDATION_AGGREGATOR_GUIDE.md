# Recommendation Aggregator System

## Overview

The Recommendation Aggregator is a central system that consolidates and prioritizes SEO recommendations across all analysis areas using a scientific scoring methodology. It transforms scattered recommendations into a unified, prioritized action plan.

## Priority Scoring Formula

**Priority Score = (Business Impact √ó 0.4) + (SEO Impact √ó 0.3) + (Urgency √ó 0.2) + (10 - Implementation Effort √ó 0.1)**

### Scoring Dimensions (1-10 scale):

- **Business Impact**: Revenue potential, conversion impact
- **SEO Impact**: Search ranking potential, traffic increase  
- **Urgency**: Critical issues vs. optimization opportunities
- **Implementation Effort**: Technical complexity, time required

## Current Implementation: Technical SEO Focus

The initial implementation focuses on **Technical SEO recommendations** from your current analysis pipeline:

### Technical Categories Processed:
- **Meta Optimizations** (title tags, meta descriptions)
- **Core Web Vitals** (LCP, CLS, FID improvements)
- **Mobile Optimization** (usability, responsive design)
- **Crawling & Indexing** (robots.txt, sitemaps, crawl errors)
- **Structured Data** (schema markup, rich snippets)
- **General Technical** (SSL, redirects, canonical URLs)

## How It Works

### 1. Integration with Analysis Pipeline

```python
# In core/analysis_processor.py
from .recommendation_aggregator import RecommendationAggregator

# After generating OpenAI analysis
aggregator = RecommendationAggregator()
aggregator.set_business_context(business_context)
aggregator.add_technical_seo_recommendations(analysis)

# Get prioritized results
prioritized_recs = aggregator.get_prioritized_recommendations()
quick_wins = aggregator.get_quick_wins()
action_plan_summary = aggregator.generate_action_plan_summary()
```

### 2. Business Context Adjustments

The system adjusts scoring based on your business model:

- **E-commerce**: Higher priority for mobile optimization, page speed (conversion impact)
- **SaaS**: Emphasis on user experience, dashboard performance
- **Local Services**: Mobile-first, local SEO optimizations
- **Professional Services**: Authority building, thought leadership

### 3. Output Structure

Each recommendation includes:

```json
{
  "recommendation_id": "tech_123456789",
  "title": "Optimize Meta Descriptions",
  "category": "technical",
  "subcategory": "meta_optimization",
  "priority_score": 8.2,
  "business_impact": 8,
  "seo_impact": 9,
  "urgency": 6,
  "implementation_effort": 2,
  "description": "Current meta descriptions are not optimized...",
  "implementation_steps": ["Step 1", "Step 2", "Step 3"],
  "success_metrics": ["CTR improvement", "SERP click-through increase"],
  "timeline": "1-3 days",
  "business_context_adjustment": "High priority for e-commerce: Direct impact on conversion rates"
}
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Business Context Integration
The system uses your existing business analysis data to weight recommendations appropriately based on:
- Business model (E-commerce, SaaS, Local Services, etc.)
- Target market (B2B vs B2C)
- Industry sector
- Company size and maturity

### Scoring Methodology
Each recommendation is evaluated across four dimensions with business context adjustments:

1. **Business Impact Calculation**: Revenue/conversion potential
2. **SEO Impact Assessment**: Ranking/traffic improvement potential  
3. **Urgency Evaluation**: Critical issues vs. optimization opportunities
4. **Implementation Effort Estimation**: Technical complexity and time requirements

The weighted formula ensures business impact gets the highest consideration (40%) while balancing SEO effectiveness (30%), urgency (20%), and implementation efficiency (10%).

This creates a truly business-aligned SEO strategy rather than generic technical recommendations.
