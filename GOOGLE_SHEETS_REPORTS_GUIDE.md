## 📋 **How Report Generation Works**

### **When Reports Generate:**
1. **Manual Trigger**: Run the report generation script
2. **Per User**: Generate for specific user by email
3. **Bulk Processing**: Generate for all users with configured websites

### **Data Source (Google Sheets):**
- **Users Sheet**: Contains user emails and website URLs
- **Website Column**: `website_url` field in your users sheet
- **Recipient**: User's email address from the `email` field

### **Report Delivery:**
1. **PDF Generation**: Creates enhanced PDF with prioritized recommendations
2. **Email Sending**: Automatically emails the report to the user
3. **Local Storage**: PDFs saved in `core/reports/generated/`

## 🎯 **Setup & Configuration**

### **1. Environment Variables (.env file)**

Add these to your `.env` file:

```bash
# OpenAI (for SEO analysis)
